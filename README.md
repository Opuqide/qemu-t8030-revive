# QEMU-T8030-REVIVE README

QEMU is a generic and open source machine & userspace emulator and
virtualizer.

This project is meant to revive an existing repository called [qemu-t8030](https://github.com/TrungNguyen1909/qemu-t8030). With active updates, and people wanting to contribute to fixing up the emulator and updating it, this project is meant to be able to run TrungNguyen1909's iPhone 11 on iOS 14.

A [Wiki](https://github.com/opuqide/qemu-t8030-revive/wiki) is provided with instructions on how to install the emulator, including how to install the proper virtual machines.
